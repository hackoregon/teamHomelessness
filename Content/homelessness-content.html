<h2>It's no secret</h2>

<img src="#" alt="Person wrapped in blankets on sidewalk outside of 24 hour convenience store." />

<p>Across the country and here in Portland, Oregon, homelessness is an urgent challenge. The concerns of citizens, business leaders, and community service organizations are well-documented and reached a fevered pitch when four people lacking adequate shelter died of exposure during the first ten days of 2017.<sup><a href="#">1</a>, <a href="#">2</a>, <a href="#">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Unsheltered</strong> seeks to make information about homelessness in our community easier to access, so that government, business, and social sector leaders, together with Multnomah-county residents from all corners, can find solutions.</p>

<p>We invited you to explore <strong>Unsheltered</strong>.</p>

    <li>What is homelessness?</li>
    <li>Who is homeless?</li>
    <li>Where do the unsheltered sleep?</li>
    <li>What conditions do the unsheltered sleep under?</li>
    <li>Were the unsheltered homeless on arrival?</li>
    <li>What services do the homeless request?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<img src="#" alt="Tents, tarps, and shopping carts under trees in a public park." />

<p>It seems simple. Homelessness suggests the absence of a home. But definitions get slippery quickly. Is homelessness the absence of a home tonight? Or ongoing? If a family shelters with relatives because they cannot afford a home of their own, are they homeless? Is a foster child who turns 18 and is exited from care homeless? What about a returned veteran sleeping on a friend's couch? A 16-year old runaway?</p>

<h3>The Point-in-Time Count</h3>

<p><strong>Unsheltered</strong> explores data from the Multnomah County 2015 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count of homelessness. The PIT count is an effort to document the number of people who are experiencing homelessness on a single night in January—all over the county. It is required by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), employs a common methodology, and engages thousands of volunteers in walking city streets to count the number of people experiencing homelessness and document information about them. The data these volunteers collect helps inform the actions of leaders in government, philanthropy and the private sector.</p>

<p>However, the PIT count is not comprehensive. It does not include people temporarily staying with extended family or couchsurfers staying with friends – a practice commonly called "doubling up," which the County uses other methods to estimate.</p>

<h3>Homelessness Defined</h3>

<img src="#" alt="Boots laying in the grass next to a fence." />

<p>Multnomah County has published a PIT report every two years since 2009. Homeless policy changes as the needs of communities and people shift, making what is already a complex undertaking more challenging. HUD has changed the definition of "homeless" over time to reflect these policy change and to encourage more consisted interpretations of them.</p>

<p>
    For example, in 2015, 689 beds that had been classified as Transitional Housing in 2013 were reclassified as Rapid Rehousing beds in 2015. The people using those beds no longer fell within the HUD definition of homeless. That is why the numbers in the aggregate and within each shelter category are not strictly comparable.<sup><a href="#">4</a>, <a href="#">5</a>, <a href="#">6</a></sup>
</p>

<h3>Exploring the Numbers</h3>

<p>Unsheltered seeks to render Multnomah County's 2015 PIT Count data easier for more people to understand, helping to improve policy and accelerate solutions. The Unsheltered team has produced a range of visualizations highlighting key data points—who is homeless, where they come from, and where they shelter.</p>

<p>We also crafted stories around select data points we wanted to better understand. For these, we engaged the experts—the many people who dedicate their professional lives to improving the circumstances of people experiencing homeless and their families, and making our community a better place.</p>

<h1>Does Domestic Violence Drive Homelessness?</h1>


<p>Yes. Domestic violence is a primary cause of homelessness for women* (and their children) nationally, in Oregon, and in Multnomah County. The causal relationship can be direct—as when a woman leaves her home with no place to go out of concern for her immediate safety. But it can also be indirect—a woman may miss work because of an injury inflicted by a family member, for example, which reduces her financial independence, compromises her mental health, and increases the risk of housing instability or homelessness if she does leave.</p>

<p>The 2015 Count revealed that 45% of homeless women in Multnomah County are affected by domestic violence—nearly one in two women who participated.</p>

<p>In 2015, homeless women experienced
    <!-- [higher/lower] -->levels of domestic violence, and were
    <!--  [more/less] -->likely to be disabled.</p>
