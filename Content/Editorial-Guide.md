## Editorial Guide
This document is for all content writers (journalists, storytellers, etc.) drafting narrative for the Hack Oregon Homelessness project. 

At the minute, it’s a running list of rules intended to keep us consistent. If you are drafting content, please:

1. Check this page before you begin drafting, and adhere to any rules/guidelines listed as you write.
2. If you make an editorial decision about language or framing that needs to be consistent throughout the site, add it to the list. 
3. If you want to contest a rules, explain what and why, and then ping the “Content” team in slack.

### Rules
1. Use “people experiencing homelessness” rather than “the homeless” or “homeless people” whenever possible. 

2. All numbered years should be listed from earliest to most recent.
